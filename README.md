With this project, I learned how to make a very basic HTML page. 

Beginning with the Homepage, I named it 'index.html'. 

Afterwards, I created another directory with the name of 'recipes'. 

Within the 'recipes' directory I created another HTML file for my first recipe called 'mac&cheese.html'. 

Also, within the 'recipes' directory, I created another file named 'images' so I can store the pictures for my different recipes.

Making this boilerplate HTML page helped me to not only create an HTML webpage but as well as to create ordered and unordered lists.
